        <p class="text">Hi there, I'm Tomoe! I've just started my third year of law school, but I have the sinking feeling that I'm probably not going to end up practicing law. I'm passionate about improving access to justice, and that's a problem that can't be solved with just learning how the law works in a vacuum. It's also a question of how people interact with legal systems. I like learning about new ways to look at problems -- 
        whether it's law, computing or learning how to play a better game of Reversi. If my college education is going to be as transformative as I'd like it to be, I'm probably going to graduate wanting things that are very different from when I first started school, and that's okay.
        <br><br> I'd like to be part of the TechLadies Bootcamp as I think having a community of people to learn with is really important - I've been fiddling around on and off for the past year or so, and it'd be great to have a group of people to learn with and hold each other accountable for learning (while also making things that help others)! I volunteer with Transient Workers Count Too and have interned at Justice Without Borders before, and case management is always an ongoing concern, so it'd be awesome to build the features that I wish existed.
